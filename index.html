              <h2 class="m-portfolioItem-title">Ellipsen</h2>
              <h3 class="m-portfolioItem-subtitle">Eine kurze Erklärung</h3>
              <p>In mathematics, an ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on 
                the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. As such, it generalizes a 
                circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. </p>
              <p>Ellipses are the closed type of conic section: a plane curve tracing the intersection of a cone with
                a plane. Ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections, parabolas and 
                hyperbolas, both of which are open and unbounded. An angled cross section of a cylinder is also an ellipse. </p>
              <p>Ellipses are common in physics, astronomy and engineering. For example, the orbit of each planet in the 
                solar system is approximately an ellipse with the Sun at one focus point (more precisely, the focus is 
                the barycenter of the Sun–planet pair). The same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems 
                of two astronomical bodies. The shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids. 
                A circle viewed from a side angle looks like an ellipse: that is, the ellipse is the image of a 
                circle under parallel or perspective projection. The ellipse is also the simplest Lissajous figure 
                formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency: a similar effect 
                leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics.

          <p>Closed captioning and subtitling are both processes of displaying text on a television, video screen, 
            or other visual display to provide additional or interpretive information. Both are typically used as 
            a transcription of the audio portion of a program as it occurs (either verbatim or in edited form), 
            sometimes including descriptions of non-speech elements. Other uses have been to provide a textual alternative 
            language translation of a presentation's primary audio language that is usually burned-in to the video and 
            unselectable. </p>

          <p>An image is an artifact that depicts visual perception, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional 
            picture, particularly one that resembles a subject (usually a physical object). In the context of signal 
            processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).</p>
